# ☕ Having Freetime

> _“Because good code is what happens when you’re bored and brilliant.”_

Welcome to **Having Freetime** — a fun little corner of the internet where I park my curiosity, explore weird ideas, and bring code to life in the most entertaining ways.

This repository is my playground — a space to share random, clever, nostalgic, and sometimes useless (but awesome) programs built when I have... well, free time. 😄

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

🌀 **ASCII Animations**  
- Like a rotating donut? Yes. In ASCII. With real-time shading.

🧪 **Experimental Snippets**  
- Algorithms I found interesting, rewrote, broke, and fixed again.

🎮 **Mini Console Games**  
- Because "Hello World" gets boring after the 100th time.

🔧 **One-file Wonders**  
- No frameworks. No build systems. Just pure code.

🎨 **Visual Tricks in Text**  
- Spinners, clocks, graphs — all inside your terminal.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Coding doesn't always have to be about deadlines and deliverables.  
Sometimes, it's just about having fun, trying something new, and seeing what happens.

**"Having Freetime"** is where I:
- 💡 Turn small ideas into cool demos  
- 📜 Recreate old-school terminal effects  
- 🧩 Solve puzzles and twist classic problems  
- 🧠 Learn through play

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Pick any folder or file that looks interesting.
2. Read the comments, run the code.
3. Tweak something. Break it. Fix it.  
4. Share it with someone who needs a smile. 😄

You can run most of the code in:
- Any modern terminal (for Java/C-based ASCII stuff)
- Online compilers (like Replit, OnlineGDB, etc.)
- A simple IDE like VS Code or IntelliJ

## 🤹 Contributions?

For now, this is a personal repo — a digital sketchbook.  
But if you’ve got a **wildly creative snippet** you think belongs here, feel free to fork and flex your freetime too!
